## This is an unfinished project
The game board is ready, you can move the game pieces on to the board and roll the die. 
As the next step, I want to have a feature of highlighting the correct tile - how can I do that?

I also don't have the following things yet: the multiplying feature, choosing one of multiple options and the winning condition.

## The rules of the game:
The objective of the game is to fill in the little square making a 3x3 grid. A player rolls the die and puts one game piece on the  corresponding place on the board. When she rolls again, she can multiply the value on the die by the value of the place where she has her game piece if the product of the hat multiplication sum can be found among the nine numbers on the 3x3 grid. If not, the player either puts another game piece on the board, to fill the value of the last roll, or misses a turn.
